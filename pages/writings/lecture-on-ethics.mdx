"Ethics, if it is anything, is supernatural and our words will only express facts."

"Thus in ethical and religious language we seem constantly to be using similes.
But a simile must be the simile for something. And if I can describe a fact by
means of a simile I must also be able to drop the simile and to describe the
facts without it. Now in our case as soon as we try to drop the simile and
simply to state the facts which stand behind it, we find that there are no such
facts. And so, what at first appeared to be a simile now seems to be mere
nonsense."

"... we have not yet succeeded in finding the correct logical analysis of what
we mean by our ethical and religious expressions"

"That is to say: I see now that these nonsensical expressions were not
nonsensical because I had not yet found the correct expressions, but that their
nonsensicality was their very essence."

"My whole tendency and I believe the tendency of all men who ever tried to write
or talk Ethics or Religion was to run against the boundaries of language. This
running against the walls of our cage is perfectly, absolutely hopeless. Ethics
so far as it springs from the desire to say something about the ultimate meaning
of life, the absolute good, the absolute valuable, can be no science. What it
says does not add to our knowledge in any sense. But it is a document of a
tendency in the human mind which I personally cannot help respecting deeply and
I would not for my life ridicule it."
