## The World as Representation

"The world is my representation": this is a truth valid with reference to
every living and knowing being, although man alone can bring it into reflective,
abstract consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical discernment has dawned on him. (3)

The subjective correlative of matter or of causality... is *understanding*,
and it is nothing more than this. To know causality is the sole function of the understanding,
its only power, and it is a great power embracing much. Conversely, all causality,
hence all matter, and consequently the whole of reality, is only for the understanding,
through the understanding, in the understanding. (11)

The whole world of objects is and remains representation, and is for this reason
wholly and for ever conditioned by the subject; in other words, it has
transcendental ideality. BUt it is not on that account falsehood or illusion;
it presents itself as what it is, as representation, and indeed as a series of
representations, whose common bond is the principle of sufficient reason. As such it is intelligible to the
healthy understanding, even according to its innermost meaning, and
**to the understanding it speaks a perfectly clear language.**
To dispute about its reality can occur only to a mind perverted by oversubtle sophistry;
such disputing always occurs through an incorrect application of the principle of sufficient reason.
(15)

Over the abstract representations, the concepts connected to judgments,
the principle of sufficient reason certainly rules in such a way that each of these has its worth,
its validity, its whole existence, here called *truth*, simply and solely through the relation
of the judgment to something outside it, to its ground of knowledge, to which therefore there must always be a return.
On the other hand, over real objects, the representations of perception, the principle of sufficient reason
rules as the principle not of the ground of *knowing*, but of *becoming*, as the law of causality.
Each of them has paid its debt to it by having *become*, in other words, by having appeared as effect from a cause.
Thus the world of perception raises no question or doubt in the observer, so long as he remains in contact with it.
Here there is neither error nor truth, for these are confined to the province of the abstract, of reflection.
(15)

## The Purpose of Reason

The abstract concepts of reason can only serve to handle what is immediately understood, to fix and arrange this, but never to bring
about understanding itself.
(21)

[Those great discoveries of science] are not the product of long chains of abstract reasoning; these, on the contrary,
serve to fix the immediate knowledge of the understsanding for the faculty of reason by setting down knowledge in the
abstract concepts of such reason, in other words, to make it clear, to be in a position to point out and explain it to others.
(22)

All such deceptive illusions stand before us in immediate perception which cannot be removed by any argument of reason.
Such arguments can prevent merely error, that is to say, a judgment without sufficient ground or reason, by forming an opposite judgment that is true.
But the illusion remains unshakable in all the cases mentioned, in spite of all abstract knowledge; for the understanding is
completely and totally different from the faculty of reason; and indeed the understanding is in itself irrational.
**Reason can always only *know*; perception remains free from its influence, and belongs to the understanding alone.**
(25)

### Emergence of Logic

However little practical use logic may have, it cannto be denied that it was invented for
practical purposes. As the pleasure of debate developed more and more...
the confusion in which nearly every debate ended was bound to make them feel the necessity for a method of procedure
as a guide, and for this a scientific dialectic had to be sought. (47)

### The Concept of Feeling

The concept denoted by the word *feeling* has only a *negative* content, namely
that something present in consciousness is *not a concept, not abstract knowledge of reason*...
Reason itself, strange as it may sound, renders itself guilty of the same one-sidedness, indeed, one may say of the same
crude ignorance from pride, since it classifies under the one concept of *feeling* every modification
of consciousness which does not belong directly to its own method of representation, in other words,
which is *not abstract concept.* (51-52)

### The Balance of Reason

Reason is necessary in the high stress of life where rapid decisions, bold action,
quick and firm comprehension are needed, but if it gains the upper hand, if it confuses
and hinders the intuitive, immediate discovery of what is right by the pure understanding,
and at the same time prevents this from being grapsed, and if it produces irresolution,
then it can easily ruin everything. (58)

It cannot be denied that the application of reason is necessary for the pursuit of a
virtuous way of living; yet it is not the source of this, but its function is a subordinate one;
to preserve resolutions once formed, to provide maxims for withstanding the weakness of the moment, and to give
consistency to conduct...
abstract rational knowledge is the reflex of the representation from perception. (58)

### Scientific Thinking

This way of knowledge from the universal to the particular, peculiar to the sciences,
makes it necessary that in them much is established by deduction from previous propositions,
that is by proofs. This has given rise to the old error that only what is demonstrated is perfectly true, and that
every truth requires a proof. On the contrary, every proof or
demonstration requires *an undemonstrated truth,* and this
ultimately supports it or again its own proofs. (64)
