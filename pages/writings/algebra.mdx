# 5. Permutation Groups

- A cycle of length $k$ has order $k$.
- The order of the product of two disjoint cycles is its least common multiple.
- Every permutation is the product of disjoint cycles.

The dihedral group, $D_n$, is a subgroup of $S_n$ of order $2n$.
$$
D_n = \{ 1, r, r^2, \cdots, r^{n - 1}, sr, sr^2, \cdots, sr^{n - 1} \},
$$
where $r$ = rotation, $s$ = reflection.
