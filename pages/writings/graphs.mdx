# 6. Bipartite Graphs

**Lemma 6.1:** Trees are bipartite. (Proof by induction.)

**Theorem 6.2:** Let $G$ be a graph, then the following are equivalent:
- $G$ is bipartite.
- $G$ contains no closed walk of odd length.
- $G$ contains no cycles with an odd number of vertices.

# 7. Matchings of Bipartite Graphs

## Definitions

A **matching** $M$ of graph $G$ is a collection of non-loop edges of $G$ such that
every vertex is incident to at most one edge in $M$.

$X \subset G$ is a **vertex cover** if all edges of $G$ have an end in $X$.

$\nu(G)$ = maximum matching number; $\tau(G)$ = minimum vertex cover.

## Theorems

**Lemma 7.1:** Let $G$ be a graph, then $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G) \leq 2\nu(G)$.

**Lemma 7.2:** A matching $M$ in $G$ has maximum size if and only if there does
not exist an $M$-augmenting path in $G$.

**Theorem 7.3** (Konig): If $G$ is bipartite, then $\nu(G) = \tau(G)$.

**Theorem 7.4:** Let $d \geq 1$ be an integer and $G$ be a bipartite graph s.t. $\text{deg}_G(v) = d$
for every $v \in G$.  Then, there exists a **perfect matching** of $G$. (A matching is perfect if every
vertex of $G$ is incident to an edge in $M$.)

**Theorem 7.5:** Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with bipartition ($A, B$).
Let $N(S)$ denote the set of vertices that are adjacent to at least one vertex in the set $S$.
Then $G$ has a matching $M$ covering $A$ (every vertex of $A$ is incident to an edge of $M$) if
and only if $N(S) \geq S$ for every $S \subset A$.
