## About

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student interested in how mental
representations of the world work. To that extent, I am interested in
artificial intelligence, psychoanalysis, and logic.

I am currently working on:

- A series of essays, <Highlight>On the Problem of Pride</Highlight>,
in which I have been laying the philosophical groundwork for an
analysis of psychological growth.
- <Highlight href="https://github.com/jinh0/gentzen">An automated theorem prover</Highlight>
for propositional logic written in OCaml and TypeScript.

A lot of people ask me what books to read, so <Highlight href="/books">here is a list of books</Highlight>.

{/* Here's <Highlight href="/writings/groups"> some notes about group theory</Highlight>. */}
