## About

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student interested in how the world
can be represented by the human mind. To that extent, I am interested in
artificial intelligence, psychoanalysis, and logic.

**I am currently working on:**

- A series of essays, <Highlight>The Structure of Change</Highlight>,
in which I am attempting to lay out the philosophical groundwork for what constitutes a change
in personality.
- <Highlight href="https://github.com/jinh0/gentzen">An automated theorem prover</Highlight>
for propositional logic written in OCaml and TypeScript.

**Below are some questions I am currently trying to answer. If you have an answer to any of them, please contact me:**

- To what extent is our understanding of others through *projection*?
- Why is the function of the unconscious *compensatory*?
- What distinguishes a good story from a bad one?
- What exactly distinguishes unconscious and conscious thinking?


A lot of people ask me what books to read, so <Highlight href="/books">here is a list of books</Highlight>.
