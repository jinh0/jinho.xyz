## About

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student interested in understanding how the world
is represented by the human mind. To that extent, I am interested in artificial
intelligence, psychoanalysis, and logic.

**I am currently working on:**

- A series of essays, [On the Problem of Pride](),
in which I am attempting to lay out the philosophical groundwork for what constitutes a change
in personality.
- [An automated theorem prover](https://github.com/jinh0/gentzen)
for propositional logic written in OCaml and TypeScript.

A lot of people ask me what books to read, so [here is a list of books](/books).

Some notes on [real analysis](/writings/analysis), [abstract algebra](/writings/algebra), and [graph theory](/writings/graphs).

Some notes on [*The World as Will and Representation* by Arthur Schopenhauer](/writings/world-as-representation).
