## About

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student interested in how mental
representations of the world work. To that extent, I am interested in
artificial intelligence, psychoanalysis, and logic.

I am currently working on:

for propositional logic written in OCaml and TypeScript.

A lot of people ask me what books to read, so <Highlight href="/books">here is a list of books</Highlight>.
